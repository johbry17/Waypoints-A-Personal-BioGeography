## Project Overview

**Waypoints: A GeoBiography** is a map-based storytelling project—an interactive memoir composed of travels, memories, and photos. What began as a simple way to pin photos on a map, so I can bore others with my vacation photos, soon evolved into a full-stack geospatial app integrating **Leaflet.js**, **Python**, and a suite of open mapping APIs.

It’s a digital keepsake, visualized through:
- 📍 Custom markers with photo carousels
- 🥾 Activity overlays (e.g., hiking, snorkeling, kayaking)
- 🛫 Route mapping for planes, boats, trains, and more

At its core is a flexible geospatial engine powered by GeoJSON and open-source APIs like **Overpass**, **OpenRouteService**, and **Nominatim**, with data managed via Google Sheets. [View Data Dictionary](data_dictionary.md).

## Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Leaflet Map** with zoomable, pan-able layers
- 🖼️ **Photo Carousels** in location popups
- 🎯 **Activity Icons & Overlays** (hiking, snorkeling, sightseeing, etc.)
- 🛣️ **Transportation Routes** for air, road, rail, boat, and foot
- 📍 **Custom Marker Clustering** for performance and clarity
- 🌐 **Multi-source Geospatial Data Integration** (OSM, APIs, hand-drawn)
- 📱 **Responsive UI** for desktop and mobile

## Tools & Technologies

- **Frontend**: Leaflet.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (data ingestion and cleaning)
- **Geospatial APIs**: OpenRouteService, Overpass API, Nominatim
- **Data Formats**: GeoJSON, CSV
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

## Usage

The project is live at [johbry17.github.io/Waypoints-A-GeoBiography.](https://johbry17.github.io/Waypoints-A-GeoBiography/).

To explore:
1. Navigate the map to explore custom markers
2. Click any marker to view associated photo galleries and descriptions
3. Use the layer control to toggle activities and route types

To update the data:
- Run `extract_data.ipynb` inside the `resources/` directory to regenerate from source sheets and GeoJSON files.
