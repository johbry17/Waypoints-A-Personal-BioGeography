# Waypoints: A GeoBiography
A map of memories, events, and photos in my life

This started as a place to store my photos and, in the spirit of data visualization, rapidly answer the question, "Where have you traveled?"

It's rapidly turning into a biography of life highlights.

Also, surprisingly, it's turned into a data engineering project. I envisioned plunking down a few markers with a pop-up carousel of photos, but the scope creep has begun.
